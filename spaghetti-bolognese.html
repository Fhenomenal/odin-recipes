        Cooking Steps
    </h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Add the olive oil and onion to a large saucepan and cook over a medium heat 
                for 2-3 minutes, until the onion begins to soften. Add the carrot and celery
                 and cook for 4-5 minutes, then add the pancetta. Season and stir well, cooking 
                 for 2 minutes until the pancetta becomes crispy. Add the garlic and rosemary, 
                 cooking for another 1 minute.
            </li>
            <li>
                Break in the mince using a wooden spoon and brown all over for about 3-4 minutes. 
                Add the chicken livers and stir well to combine, then add a pinch of the grated 
                nutmeg. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour in the wine and allow to reduce for 1 minute, before pouring in the chopped 
                tomatoes. Bring to the boil, cover and simmer gently for 60-75 minutes, 
                topping up with more liquid if needed. Remove the lid for the last 15 minutes 
                so the sauce thickens.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti according to the instructions on the packet. Drain 
                and divide between four plates. Spoon over the bolognese and serve sprinkled with
                 parmesan and fresh basil leaves.
